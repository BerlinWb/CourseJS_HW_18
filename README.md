implementation of the padString function that takes 4 arguments

1.string
2.a number that is the long string we want to return as a result of the function.
3.character (string 1 character long) - which will be added to the string, if necessary
4.a boolean parameter (true or false) that determines whether to add characters to the left or right (right by default)
When writing a function, it is imperative to check the arguments that we passed, and if there are no arguments, then return a string with an error from the function (return ‘some error’). The error message should be different depending on the condition for which the check failed.
